### About myself
After graduating from a technical university my interest in engineering led me to working as a stress engineer in a division of one of France's leading aircraft engine manufacturers.

I became interested in programming by writing small scripts to automate routine operations and creating extensions for engineering software in Python. And one day I participated in the development of a small web application and from that moment I understood that I want to become web developer.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Web Developer.

### Code example
```
function binary_search(search_list, guess_numb){
   let first = 0
   let last = search_list.length - 1
   while (first <= last) {
      let mid = (first + last) / 2
      let curr_value = search_list[mid]
      if (curr_value == guess_numb) {
         return mid
      } else if (curr_value > guess_numb) {
         last = mid - 1
      } else {
         first = mid + 1
      }
   }
